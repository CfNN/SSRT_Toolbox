function GenRandomTrials(n_trials, n_stopTrials, n_enforcedInitialGoTrials, n_maxConsecStopTrials)
% GENRANDOMTRIALS - Generates a pseudo-random block of trials. Trial
% order is random with certain enforced features (see below).
%
% Usage: GenRandomTrials(n_trials, n_stopTrials, n_enforcedInitialGoTrials, n_maxConsecStopTrials); 
%
% Eg. for a randomized trial sequence with 128 trials, 32 stop trials, 8 go 
% trials at the beginning, and no more than 3 stop trials in a row, use:
% GenRandomTrials(128, 32, 8, 3);
%
% n_trials: Total number of trials in the session
%
% n_stopTrials: Number of stop trials in session - the rest are go trials
%
% n_enforcedInitialGoTrials: The number of go trials at the beginning of
% the session before any stop trials should be allowed. Set to zero if it's
% alright for there to be stop trials right at the beginning.
% 
% n_maxConsecStopTrials: The maximum number of consecutive stop trials that
% should be allowed. Set equal to n_trials if it doesn't matter if there
% are several consecutive stop trials by chance.
