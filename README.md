# Overview

UNDER CONSTRUCTION: A toolbox for running and analyzing data from customizable stop signal task experiments

# Documentation

SSRT Toolbox Guidebook.docx - a comprehensive guide on how to use the code in this repository, including lots of details on how the code works, automated software tests for quality assurance, etc:

Quick Guide - running the stop signal task.docx - intended as a "cheat-sheet" for the staff person running the task with participants:

SSRT Toolbox Code Documentation.docx - contains pastes of the documentation at the top of each .m code file in the SSRT Toolbox. While an effort will be made to keep this up to date if/when changes are made, it is more reliable to find the same information in the .m code files themselves:

# Legacy E-Prime SSRT code/documentation

Although running the task in MATLAB instead of E-Prime is highly recommended, an updated E-Prime version of the task is also provided here:

The SSRT Toolbox provides MATLAB scripts to convert the E-Prime .txt data files into MATLAB format so that they can be analyzed by the same suite of provided data analysis scripts. Please see SSRT Toolbox Guidebook.docx (link above) and E-Prime SSRT Guidebook.docx (link below) for details. 

E-Prime SSRT Guidebook.docx - contains all documentation for the E-Prime version of the task (including a 1-page cheat sheet):
