function TimingDiscrepancy_manualtest(filename)
% TIMINGDISCREPANCY_MANUALTEST - Manually test whether the timing of an
% experiment session was precisely as intended, particularly whether the 
% stop signal was presented on time (ie stop signal delay was no longer or 
% shorter than expected). You will need to examine the output of this 
% function on the console to determine whether the SSD discrepancies are 
% within acceptable limits for your experiment.

% Example usage: TimingDiscrepancy_manualtest('subj1_sess1_SSRT.mat');
